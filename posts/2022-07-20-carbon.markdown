Ребята замахиваются на совместимость с c++ и при этом на нормальный язык, выглядит очень интересно!

That's an exciting find! 

The Carbon Language project is indeed aiming for something ambitious: creating a modern programming language that maintains **bidirectional interoperability with C++**, while addressing many of C++'s complexities and historical baggage. 

From the philosophy and goals document, it's clear the team is focused on:
- **Seamless migration**: Code should be able to call between C++ and Carbon without significant overhead or complexity.
- **Modern language features**: Carbon aims to include memory safety, generics, and better tooling.
- **Gradual adoption**: The goal is to let developers migrate incrementally rather than requiring a full rewrite.
